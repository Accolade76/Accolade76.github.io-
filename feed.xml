This is a highly necessary step in preventing the spread of the virus and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flattenthecurve.com/&quot;&gt;flattening the curve&lt;/a&gt;. However, as some countries appear to be getting the spread of the virus under control there are already sounds about “opening up” certain countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reasons for “opening up” are myriad but, aside from the &lt;a href=&quot;&quot;&gt;discomfort many people seem to feel&lt;/a&gt; at being socially isolated, the biggest driver is probably the state of our economies. The pressure for people who are currently not earning a livelihood &lt;a href=&quot;&quot;&gt;is enormous&lt;/a&gt; and the stimulus packages being provided in most countries are either &lt;a href=&quot;&quot;&gt;insufficient&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;&quot;&gt;simply not materializing&lt;/a&gt;. Businesses are &lt;a href=&quot;&quot;&gt;already folding&lt;/a&gt; under the financial pressure and if this state of isolation needs to be prolonged, it will only hurt us further.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the promising start some countries have made in getting the pandemic under control, the outlook on opening up is &lt;a href=&quot;&quot;&gt;still bleak&lt;/a&gt;. It is possible that the there may be multiple waves of COVID-19 in the coming months and even that it may [become endemic]. The concern that this period of isolation may stretch for longer than businesses can tolerate has led to &lt;a href=&quot;&quot;&gt;proposals of opening up businesses while respecting social distancing&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
